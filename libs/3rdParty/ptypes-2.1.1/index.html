<p> <b>PTypes</b> (C++ Portable Types Library) is a simple alternative to the 
STL that includes multithreading and networking. It defines dynamic strings, variants, 
character sets, lists and other basic data types along with portable thread and 
synchronization objects, IP sockets and named pipes. Its main `target audience' 
is developers of complex network daemons, robots or non-visual client/server applications 
of any kind.</p>
<p>PTypes defines simple and intuitive interfaces and differs from the STL in 
fairly moderate use of templates. The library is portable across many modern operating 
systems (currently Linux, MacOS X, SunOS, FreeBSD, HP-UX and Windows). All platform-dependent 
issues are hidden inside. A simple web server called wshare is included in the 
package to demonstrate the full power of the library.</p>
<p>And finally, PTypes is open and free. </p>
