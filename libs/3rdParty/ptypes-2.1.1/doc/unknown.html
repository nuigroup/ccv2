<p>The <span class="lang">unknown</span> interface is the base for all interfaces 
(classes) in PTypes, <b>except</b> <span class="lang">string</span>, <span class="lang">cset</span>, 
<span class="lang">variant</span>, <span class="lang">mutex</span>, <span class="lang">rwlock</span>, 
<span class="lang">msgqueue</span> and <span class="lang">tpodlist</span>. The 
<span class="lang">unknown</span> class has no semantic or functional meaning, 
except that deriving a class from <span class="lang">unknown</span> provides a 
simple mechanism of tracking the number of created/destroyed objects in a program. 
Historically, <span class="lang">unknown</span> was used in PTypes as a base for 
all list item types, however, starting from version 2.0 of the library this requirement 
is no longer in place.</p>
<p>The <span class="lang">component</span> class adds reference-counting functionality 
to <span class="lang">unknown</span> (see <span class="lang">addref()</span> and 
<span class="lang">release()</span> below). PTypes variants require objects to 
be derived from <span class="lang">component</span> instead of <span class="lang">unknown</span> 
to be able to make assignments and destruction of variants properly. See also 
<span class="lang">compref </span>below.</p>
<p>As an alternative to reference-counting <span class="lang">component</span> 
also provides so-called 'delete notification' mechanism. If object A holds a reference 
to object B, A can add itself to B's notification list to be notified when B is 
being destroyed. This allows A to take appropriate actions, e.g. invalidate the 
reference to B. A in this case can declare reference to B as a plain pointer. 
In other words, A should override its own virtual method <span class="lang">freenotify()</span>, 
and it also should call <span class="lang">addnotification(this)</span> for the 
object it holds reference to.</p>
<p>All stream objects in PTypes and aslo the <span class="lang">unit</span> class 
are derived from <span class="lang">component</span>.</p>
<p>A global variable <span class="lang">objalloc</span> is declared to keep track 
of the number of allocated objects (derived from <span class="lang">unknown</span> 
or <span class="lang">component</span>) in an application program, which can help 
you to find memory leaks or other potential bugs. The allocation counting works 
only in <span class="lang">DEBUG</span> mode. If the memory is cleaned up properly, 
this value should be zero upon program termination. You can write code, possibly 
enclosed within <span class="lang">#ifdef DEBUG ... #endif</span>, which checks 
whether this value is zero at the end of <span class="lang">main()</span>.</p>
<p>These interfaces are declared in <a href="include/ptypes.h.html">&lt;ptypes.h&gt;</a>.</p>
<p><span class="def">component* addref(component* c)</span> increments the reference 
counter for the given component object <span class="lang">c</span>. The return 
value is the same as <span class="lang">c</span> and is provided for convenience.</p>
<p><span class="def">bool release(component* c)</span> decrements the reference 
counter and destroys the object <span class="lang">c</span> if the counter reached 
0. Returns <span class="lang">true</span> if the object has been destroyed. Passing 
<span class="lang">NULL</span> to this function is not an error.</p>
<p><span class="def">template &lt;class T&gt; class compref</span> implements 
a 'smart' pointer to <span class="lang">component</span> (or any derivative class) 
with automatic reference counting. Use this template in place of a plain pointer 
declaration (e.g. <span class="lang">compref&lt;myclass&gt;</span> instead of 
<span class="lang">myclass*</span>) to automatically destroy objects as soon as 
there are no more references left. The behavior of <span class="lang">compref</span> 
pointers is similar to plain pointers, except that they perform additional actions 
when assigning new values to them.</p>
<p><span class="def">virtual component::~component()</span> destroys the component 
and calls <span class="lang">freenotify()</span> for each object in the notification 
list.</p>
<p><span class="def">component::addnotification(component* c)</span> adds object 
<span class="lang">c</span> to the notification list of this object. This object's 
destructor will then call <span class="lang">c-&gt;freenotify()</span>.</p>
<p><span class="def">component::delnotification(component* c)</span> deletes object 
<span class="lang">c</span> from this object's notification list.</p>
<p><span class="def">virtual component::freenotify(component* caller)</span> is 
called by the <span class="lang">caller</span>'s destructor for each object 
in the notification list. This method should be overriden in classes which add 
themselves to other objects' notification lists. The overridden method usually 
invalidates (assigns NULL) all references to <span class="lang">caller</span>.</p>
