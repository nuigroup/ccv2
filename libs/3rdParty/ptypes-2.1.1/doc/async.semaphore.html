<p>Semaphore is a special helper object with very simple logic which is typically 
used to synchronize the execution of concurrent threads. A semaphore object can 
be considered as an integer value which has one additional feature: if its value 
is 0, an attempt to decrement this value will cause the calling thread to &quot;hang&quot; 
until some other thread increments it. &quot;Hanging&quot; on the semaphore means 
entering effective wait state and consuming no or little CPU time, depending on 
the operating system.</p>
<p>One example showing the use of semaphores is when one thread needs to send 
data (e.g. through a buffer) to another thread. In multithreading environments 
there is no guarantee in which order two threads will come to the point where 
the first thread is filling the data buffer and the other thread is reading it. 
Therefore, these two threads need to synchronize execution at the exchange point. 
Semaphore's logic for this case is fairly simple: the reader thread calls wait() 
<i>before</i> reading the buffer and &quot;hangs&quot; if the semaphore is not 
yet signaled. The writer thread calls post() <i>after</i> filling the buffer with 
data and thus signals the reader thread that the data buffer is ready. This schema 
ensures that the data buffer will be read by the second thread only when the data 
is actually ready.</p>
<p>If the data exchange cycle is iterative you will have to make sure also that 
the buffer is not filled twice before the reading thread takes the first data 
chunk. In this situation another semaphore should be created with reverse logic: 
the semaphore is set to signaled state when the reading thread has taken the first 
data chunk and is ready to take the second chunk. The writing thread, in its turn, 
waits on this semaphore to make sure the buffer is ready for the successive data 
chunk.</p>
<p>In more complex applications when many threads need to exchange data with each 
other or with the main application thread, message queues can be used instead 
of semaphores. The message queue object itself is another example of using semaphores 
(please see <span class="lang">pmsgq.cxx</span> source file).</p>
<p>You can use semaphores when your application needs to limit the number of concurrently 
running threads of the same type. A typical web robot application, for example, 
creates a new thread for each download process. To limit the number of threads 
the application creates a semaphore with the initial value equal to the maximum 
allowed number of threads. Each new thread decrements the semaphore by calling 
<span class="lang">wait()</span> and then increments it with <span class="lang">post()</span> 
upon termination. If the maximum allowed number of threads is reached, the next 
thread calling <span class="lang">wait()</span> will &quot;hang&quot; until one 
of the running threads terminates and calls <span class="lang">post()</span>.</p>
<p>PTypes' <span class="lang">semaphore</span> object encapsulates either Windows 
semaphore or an implementation based on POSIX synchronization primitives. This 
object implements the minimal set of features common to both Windows and POSIX 
semaphores. Besides, semaphores can not be shared between processes on some operating 
systems, thus limiting the use of PTypes' semaphores to one process.</p>
<p>PTypes' <span class="lang">timedsem</span> adds timed waiting feature to 
the simple semaphore. This class has an interface compatible with the simple <span class="lang">semaphore</span> 
with one additional function - <span class="lang">wait(int)</span> with timer. 
The reason this feature is implemented in a separate class is that not all platforms 
support timed waiting. Wherever possible, PTypes uses the system's native sync 
objects, or otherwise uses its own implementation based on other primitives. Note 
that <span class="lang">timedsem</span> can be used both for infinitely waiting 
and timed waiting; it is, however, recommended to use simple <span class="lang">semaphore</span> 
if you are not going to use timed waiting.</p>
<p>As an example of using <span class="lang">timedsem</span> see implementation 
of <span class="lang">thread</span> 'relaxing' mechanism in <span class="lang">include/pasync.h</span> 
and <span class="lang">src/pthread.cxx</span>.</p>
<p><span class="def">semaphore::semaphore(int initvalue)</span> constructs a 
semaphore object with the initial value <span class="lang">initvalue</span>.</p>
<p><span class="def">void semaphore::wait()</span> decrements the semaphore's 
value by 1. <span class="lang">wait()</span> can enter effective wait state if 
the value becomes -1, in which case the thread will &quot;hang&quot; until some 
other thread increments the value by calling <span class="lang">post()</span>.</p>
<p><span class="def">void semaphore::post()</span> increments the semaphore's 
value by 1. <span class="lang">post()</span> can release some other thread waiting 
for the same semaphore if its value was -1.</p>
<p><span class="def">void semaphore::signal()</span> is an alias for <span class="lang">post()</span>.</p>
<p><span class="def">timedsem::timedsem(int initvalue)</span> constructs a 
semaphore object with an interface fully compatible with (but not inherited from) 
<span class="lang">semaphore</span>. This class has one additional method for 
timed waiting (see below).</p>
<p><span class="def">bool timedsem::wait( [ int milliseconds ] )</span> decrements 
the semaphore's value by 1 and enters effective wait state if the value becomes 
-1. Unlike simple <span class="lang">wait()</span> this function will 'wake' and 
return if the time specified in <span class="lang">milliseconds</span> has elapsed, 
in which case the function returns false. If the semaphore was signaled with <span class="lang">post()</span> 
or <span class="lang">signal()</span> before the time elapses this function returns 
true. If <span class="lang">milliseconds</span> is omitted or is -1 the function 
will wait infinitely, like simple <span class="lang">wait()</span>.</p>
