  <b>Basic features</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    
<p>Threads and synchronization primitives solve the vital problem of diversity 
of the threading API's on different platforms. The library also offers message 
queues and job queues as additional methods of thread synchronization and maintenance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> IP socket classes and utilities provide complete IP-based framework for
      both client-side and server-side programming. Combined with PTypes multithreading,
      these classes can be used for designing complex non-visual applications,
      such like network daemons or web robots.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Dynamic strings, variants, character sets, date/time type and various
      kinds of dynamic and associative arrays: Delphi programmers will find them
      very similar to the ones in their favorite language. The collection of
      these basic data types may be useful, among other things, for building
      compilers and interpreters for higher-level languages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Streaming interfaces provide buffered I/O with simple and powerful text
      parsing methods. A strictly defined syntax for a given text format or a
      formal language can be represented by calls to PTypes token extraction
      methods. The unified streaming interface is applicable to files, named
      pipes and network sockets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    
<p>Special thread class with enhanced functionality called unit. Units have their 
own main() and input/output 'plugs'; they can be connected to each other within 
one application to form pipes, like processes in the UNIX shell.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, everything above is portable: all platform-dependent details
      are hidden inside.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b><br>
  Why use PTypes?</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>PTypes is yet another generic class library among tens and hundreds of others.
    To find its own niche in this variety of generic programming tools we decided
    to emphasis on simplicity of the interfaces and readability of the resulting
    code (i.e. the code that uses the library). The library focuses
    only on most widely used data types and functional interfaces. We think that
    like programming languages themselves, low-level libraries, too, should use
    the minimal set of notions for covering most programming patterns.</p>
  
<p>Some data types in the library (strings, character sets and variants) use algebraic 
notation rather than object-oriented, i.e. you write <span class="lang">length(s)</span> 
for a string object instead of <span class="lang">s.length()</span>. We believe 
that traditional notation better fits to a class that represents some fundamental 
notion and is not supposed to produce subclasses with overridden methods. In other 
words, if there is no inheritance and polymorphism, there is no need for method 
calls as well.</p>
  <p>PTypes uses old-fashioned all-lowercase naming style, since it  can
   peacefully co-exist with other styles in one program. Whether you are a `unixoid'
   or you are using modern writing styles (Hungarian, Borland, etc.) you can
   combine your favorite style with PTypes with no or very little  harm to your
   source code.</p>
  <p>And finally, in order to achieve better readability of the resulting
    code we use
    clean
    class
    naming,
     i.e. the string type is called <span class="lang">string</span>, thread
     is <span class="lang">thread</span>,
     etc.</p>
  <p>We designed this library in the hope that PTypes with its conciseness and
    intuitiveness could find its own 'target audience'.</p>
