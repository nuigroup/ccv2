<p>The <span class="lang">ipmessage</span> class implements connectionless, unreliable 
datagram communication between IP hosts. The underlying protocol (UDP) never guarantees 
that a message will be delivered, however, in return, it has 
the ability to send broadcast messages on a local network. Unlike stream-oriented 
protocols which have some traffic overhead because of the control packets (for 
opening/closing connections and for confirming each delivery), message-oriented 
protocols always send a single packet, sometimes fragmented if it exceeds the 
size of a physical frame.</p>
<p>In summary, message-oriented communication is useful in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>For sending streaming data (as a rule, sound or video) when losing packets 
is not crucial. An application may measure the bandwidth and the reliability of 
a connection before starting a streaming session, to estimate the optimal frequency 
of packets and adjust the quality of multimedia data (e.g. frames per second, 
resolution, etc).</li>
<li>For finding hosts of a specific type on a local network using broadcast/multicast 
messages. You may want your client application to find its services on a network 
automatically to free the user from entering the addresses manually.</li>
<li>For sending very short messages or request/reply cycles, possibly with confirmation/retry 
mechanism. In most cases developing such applications may be costly compared to 
using stream-oriented protocols instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>The maximum message size is limited to 64 KBytes on most systems. Note however, 
that sending large messages may result in fragmentation and hence a lesser probability 
that the whole message will be delivered. You may assume that a maximum data size 
for a UDP message is 1472 bytes, even though such message may still be fragmented 
when transferred over a non-Ethernet medium. The size of a guaranteed indivisible 
UDP packet is 512 bytes on all physical media types.</p>
<p>For larger data chunks you may consider using streaming protocols, since the 
TCP control traffic overhead is insignificant compared to data in such cases.</p>
<p>The <span class="lang">ipmessage</span> and <span class="lang">ipmsgserver</span> 
classes are not compatible with PTypes streaming interfaces due to unreliable 
and connectionless nature of the underlying protocol. These classes provide a 
pair of low-level methods <span class="lang">receive()</span> and <span class="lang">send()</span> 
and require that the client (<span class="lang">ipmessage</span>) first call <span class="lang">send()</span> 
prior to receiving, and the server (<span class="lang">ipmsgserver</span>) must 
first receive data prior to sending. In addition, the server object can be polled 
for pending data (optionally with timed waiting) using <span class="lang">poll()</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="lang">ipmessage</span> class is reusable, i.e. you may use 
one object to send data to multiple destinations by changing the <span class="lang">ip</span> 
(or <span class="lang">host</span>) and <span class="lang">port</span> properties.</p>
<p><span class="lang">Ipmessage</span> can generate exceptions of type <span class="lang">(estream*)</span> 
with a corresponding error code and a message string.</p>
<p>(See also Example 3 in <a href="inet.examples.html">Examples</a>)</p>
<p><span class="def">ipmessage::ipmessage()</span> is the default constructor.</p>
<p><span class="def">ipmessage::ipmessage(ipaddress ip, int port)</span> constructs 
an <span class="lang">ipmessage</span> object and assigns the peer <span class="lang">ip</span>/<span class="lang">port</span> 
values. To send a broadcast message to all hosts on a local network, assign a 
predefined constant <span class="lang">ipbcast</span> to <span class="lang">ip</span>.</p>
<p><span class="def">ipmessage::ipmessage(string host, int port)</span> constructs 
an <span class="lang">ipmessage</span> object and assigns the peer host name and 
port values. Before actually sending data first time, the object resolves the 
host name to a numeric IP address. <span class="lang">Host</span> can be either 
a symbolic DNS name or a numeric address in a string form (e.g. &quot;somehost.com&quot; 
or &quot;192.168.1.1&quot;).</p>
<p><span class="def">bool ipmessage::waitfor(int milliseconds)</span> waits on 
a socket until data is available for reading (returns <span class="lang">true</span>) 
or the time specified has elapsed, in which case it returns <span class="lang">false</span>.</p>
<p><span class="def">ipmessage::send(const char* buf, int count)</span> sends 
data to the peer. <span class="lang">Ip</span>/<span class="lang">host</span> 
and <span class="lang">port</span> properties must be assigned prior to calling 
<span class="lang">send()</span>. A client must first call <span class="lang">send()</span> 
before receiving data from the peer.</p>
<p> <span class="def">ipmessage::send(string s)</span> works like the previous 
version of <span class="lang">send()</span> except that it sends the string <span class="lang">s</span> 
(not including the terminating null-symbol).</p>
<p><span class="def">int ipmessage::receive(char* buf, int count [, ipaddress&amp; 
src ] )</span> reads data from the socket. <span class="lang">Receive()</span> 
may hang if no data is available for reading. This function returns the actual 
number of bytes read. If the packet received exceeds the size of the supplied 
buffer, an exception is raised with code EMSGSIZE. You may check if there is data 
available for reading without 'hanging' using <span class="lang">waitfor()</span> 
described above. The last optional parameter <span class="lang">src</span> receives 
the IP address of the host that sent this packet: it may be useful if the packet 
is received in response to a broadcast request.</p>
<p><span class="def">string ipmessage::receive(int max [, ipaddress&amp; src ] 
)</span> works like the previous version of <span class="lang">receive()</span> 
except that it returns data in a dynamic string. The parameter <span class="lang">max</span> 
specifies the limit which may not be exceeded when reading data from the network, 
like with the previous version of <span class="lang">receive()</span>.</p>
<p><span class="def">ipaddress ipmessage::get/set_ip()</span> sets/retrieves the 
peer address in a numerical form. If the object was constructed using a symbolic 
name, <span class="lang">get_ip()</span> may perform a DNS lookup (only once). 
To send a broadcast message to all hosts on a local network, assign a predefined 
constant <span class="lang">ipbcast</span> to this property.</p>
<p><span class="def">string ipmessage::get/set_host()</span> sets/retrieves the 
peer address in a symbolic form. If the object was constructed using a numeric 
IP address, <span class="lang">get_host()</span> may perform a reverse DNS lookup.</p>
<p><span class="def">int ipmessage::get/set_port()</span> sets/retrieves the peer 
port number.</p>
<p><span class="def">ipaddress ipmessage::get_myip()</span> returns the local 
address associated with the socket.</p>
<p><span class="def">int ipmessage::get_myport()</span> returns the local port 
number associated with the socket.</p>
<p><span class="def">virtual void ipmessage::sockopt(int socket)</span> - override this method in a descendant class if you want to set up additional socket options (normally, by calling <span class="lang">setsockopt()</span>).</p>
