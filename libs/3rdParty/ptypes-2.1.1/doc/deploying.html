<p class="hpath"><a href="index.html">Top</a>: Deploying the shared (dynamic) 
library</p>
<p><b><br>
Static vs. dynamic linking</b></p>
<p>PTypes builds two separate versions of the library: static and shared (DLL 
on Windows), giving you a choice, and at the same time putting into a dilemma.</p>
<p>Both static and dynamic linking have their advantages and disadvantages. While 
small applications consisting of a single executable would prefer to link the 
library directly, more complex projects with multiple dynamic components and executables 
would greatly benefit from going 'totally dynamic', including generic low-level 
libraries, such like CRTL and PTypes. Before making a decision, consider the following:</p>
<p>Advantages of static linking in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster run-time loading (in return for slower compilation).</li>
<li>The installation process is simpler: the end-user doesn't have to deal with 
package dependencies, DLL/so versioning conflicts with other applications, etc. 
A simple application may run even without any special installation procedures.</li>
<li>Windows-specific: turning a static library into a DLL on Windows is not as 
simple as on UNIX systems. You should at least put special compiler directives 
against every public symbol in the library and thus make your header files less 
readable.</li>
<li>UNIX-specific: for security reasons, UNIX has strict policies with regard 
to finding shared libraries and managing allowed source paths. In most cases you 
will have to provide an automated installation procedure and require root privileges 
in order to place all shared libraries in the right place. Remember, UNIX is a 
true multiuser system, and often the user that downloaded/purchased your program 
does not have root access on his computer, and he doesn't want to bother the system 
administrator either. You may, of course, override LD_LIBRARY_PATH, but then shared 
libraries won't be truly shared if they are installed somewhere under user's home 
directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantages of dynamic linking in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster compilation and better modularization in big projects with distributed 
development (in return for slower run-time loading).</li>
<li>Bug fixes and improvements in library's implementation do not affect your 
application and do not require you to recompile everything. What's more, adding 
new features without changing the existing interfaces in the dynamic library, 
again, won't affect the other modules.</li>
<li>Smaller executables; dynamic libraries may be shared not only between the 
components of your project, but even between applications from different vendors. 
(The installation package should offer all dependent libraries anyway.) Freeware 
libraries perfectly suit for sharing between vendors, since they usually don't 
put any limitation on their usage, at least when linked dynamically.</li>
<li>Dynamic libraries can be loaded and bound to the main application at run-time 
allowing you to maintain functional 'drivers' (e.g. an application that extracts 
plain text from various text formats can support a generic text extraction interface; 
drivers for each format can be developed and shipped independently).</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, dynamic linking is good (1) for big projects, (2) if the library 
is widely used by many software vendors in its dynamic (shared) form or (3) to 
take advantage of run-time binding.</p>
<p><b><br>
Using and deploying UNIX shared object</b></p>
<p>PTypes builds a shared object named <span class="lang">libptypes.so.20</span> 
(<span class="lang">libptypes.20.dylib</span> on MacOS X), creates a 'default' 
symbolic link to this library and finally places them both in <span class="lang">so/</span>.</p>
<p>If you decided to link your program against PTypes shared object instead of 
the static library, then all you'd have to do is to change the library path in 
your makefile from <span class="lang">-L../ptypes/lib</span> to <span class="lang">-L../ptypes/so</span>. 
When running the program, it will require the shared library to be either in one 
of the default locations (usually <span class="lang">/usr/lib</span> and <span class="lang">/usr/local/lib</span>), 
or you will have to override the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable and point 
to the directory where the shared object resides, e.g. <span class="lang">~/ptypes/so</span>.</p>
<p>The shared object <span class="lang">libptypes.so.20</span> should be deployed 
and installed along with your application. The version number '20' will change 
when PTypes adds a number of new features and becomes bigger and/or if incompatible 
changes take place which make it impossible for older programs to use the new 
shared object.</p>
<p><b><br>
Using and deploying Windows DLL</b></p>
<p>The PTypes MSVC project is configured so that the 'release' version of <span class="lang">ptypes20.dll</span> 
along with its import library is copied into <span class="lang">so\</span> as 
the final step of the build process. This module does not contain any debugging 
information and is ready to be deployed. Note that the library itself is linked 
against the multithreaded DLL version of CRTL.</p>
<p>PTypes places a VERSION resource in the DLL, allowing the system or the setup 
program to automatically compare the existing <span class="lang">ptypes20.dll</span> 
the user may have in the system with the one that comes with your program. This 
is usually done from within the installation script.</p>
<p>The DLL version of the library built with Dev-C++/MinGW is called <span class="lang">ptypes20g.dll</span>. 
The reason this name is different is that each C++ compiler uses its own `name 
mangling' scheme for exported symbols, so that applications built by one compiler 
can't use dynamic libraries built by another one.</p>
<p><b><br>
Version checking sample code</b></p>
<p>If, for some reason, you wish to check the version of the shared library you 
linked with dynamically, you may check the global variable <span class="lang">__ptypes_version</span>, 
which is declared in <span class="lang"><a href="include/pport.h.html">&lt;pport.h&gt;</a></span>. 
This variable holds the version number encoded as a single integer, e.g. <span class="lang">0x010902</span> 
designates version 1.9.2. In this form the version numbers (required and actual) 
can be easily compared as integers.</p>
<p>Note, the name of the library itself reflects major and minor version numbers, 
so that only the third component of the version number can vary in the file.</p>
<p>If you need to check the version of PTypes before loading the library (for 
example, during the installation on UNIX), you may write a program that loads 
the shared object and reads the global symbol <span class="lang">__ptypes_version</span> 
at run-time, using the system dynamic loading interface. Note that this program 
itself is not using PTypes. Some UNIX systems require to link the program with 
<span class="lang">-ldl</span>.</p>
